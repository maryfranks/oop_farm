Assignment:

You are a farmer that wishes to keep track of the fields on your farm. You want
to be able to add fields of various types - for example, corn and wheat - and to
keep track of the harvest. You will be keeping track of the total amount of food
your farm has ever produced.

Each field type produces a different amount of food per hectare:

    corn: 20
    wheat: 30

You can add fields of choice to your farm by specifying their type (eg. "corn")
and their total area in hectares (eg. 100).

When you harvest, you must collect food from every one of your fields and record
how much total food you have collected. It should display all of this information.

Sometimes a farmer wants to relax. In doing so, you will get a chance to enjoy
the beauty of each one of your fields (without harvesting them).

You can also check the status of each field, which is a more direct way of
observing the status of your fields (their size and type). It should also tell
you how much total food you have produced up until this point.

The program should provide a list of input options whenever it asks you to enter
one.

3. Cornfield
      need:
          amount of food per hectare
4. Wheat field
          amount of food per hectare
